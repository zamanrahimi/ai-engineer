## 📐 Planning AI Applications

Before building an AI product, you must plan it properly.

🔹 **Use Case Evaluation**

You evaluate:

- Feasibility  
- Cost  
- Safety risks  
- Data requirements  
- Business value  
- Who will use it  
- What problem it solves  

You remove weak ideas and keep only strong, realistic ones.


## 🔹 Setting Expectations

AI is powerful but not magic.  
You must set correct expectations:

- AI makes mistakes  
- It must be evaluated  
- It needs guardrails  
- Humans must stay involved  
- Some tasks require fine-tuning  
- AI should automate parts of work, not everything


## 🔹 Milestone Planning

A good AI project has clear phases:

- Define problem  
- Build prototype  
- Test with users  
- Improve prompts / workflows  
- Build backend + API  
- Deploy in the cloud  
- Measure quality  

This ensures progress is predictable.


## 🔹 Maintenance

AI apps need continuous updates:

- Prompt updates  
- Model upgrades  
- Monitoring correctness  
- Fixing hallucinations  
- Improving speed and costs  
- Adding new features  

AI is not “build once and forget.”
