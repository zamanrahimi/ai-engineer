# 🔹 AI Engineering versus ML Engineering

| AI Engineer                       | ML Engineer                                    |
| --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Builds apps using existing models | Trains ML models from scratch                  |
| Focus on LLMs, APIs, cloud        | Focus on data pipelines, MLOps, feature stores |
| Works closely with product teams  | Works closely with data scientists             |
| Builds fast prototypes and apps   | Ensures scalable training + deployment         |
| Less math, more engineering       | More math, ML theory                           |


## 🔹 AI Engineering versus Full-Stack Engineering

AI Engineers and full-stack engineers share many skills, but:

| AI Engineer | Full-Stack Engineer |
|------------|-------------------|
| Builds AI intelligence into apps | Builds traditional apps |
| Works heavily with LLMs, prompts, RAG, agents | Works with databases, REST APIs, UI |
| Needs cloud + model orchestration knowledge | Needs frontend + backend skills |
| Focuses on automations and reasoning | Focuses on application logic |

AI Engineering is essentially full-stack engineering plus AI capabilities.
