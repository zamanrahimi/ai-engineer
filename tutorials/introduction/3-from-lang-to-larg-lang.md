# 🔹 From Language Models to Large Language Models

Language Models (LMs) started as small models trained to predict the next word.

For example:
Input: “How are you”
LM predicts: “doing?”

But early models were limited and could only do simple text tasks.

Large Language Models (LLMs) are language models with massive amounts of parameters and training data.
This allowed abilities like:

Understanding instructions

* Writing essays

* Summarizing documents

* Basic reasoning

* Code generation

* Conversational AI

LLMs made AI useful for everyday applications.
