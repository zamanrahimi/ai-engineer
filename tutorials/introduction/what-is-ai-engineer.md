## Who is an AI Engineer? (Simple Explanation)

An **AI Engineer** is someone who builds **smart computer systems** that can think, learn, and make decisions.
They create things like:

* Chatbots
* Recommendation systems
* Voice assistants
* Computer vision tools
* Automation systems
* AI-powered business apps

Think of an AI Engineer as a **builder** who uses data, math, and code to make machines intelligent.

AI Engineers don’t just train models — they make sure the AI actually works in **real applications**.

> **AI Engineer = builds & deploys AI systems that solve real-world problems.**

## AI Engineer vs. Data Scientist (Simple Explanation)

### Data Scientist → *Finds insights from data*

They analyze data, clean it, build models, and explain what it means.

### AI Engineer → *Builds systems that use AI in real products*

They deploy models, build APIs, create automation, and integrate AI into apps.

## Side-by-Side Comparison

| Role               | What They Do                                                   | Simple Example                                                    |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Data Scientist** | Researches data, prepares data, builds models, finds patterns  | “Why are customers leaving? Who will buy next?”                   |
| **AI Engineer**    | Builds apps using AI, deploys models, creates APIs, automation | “Create a chatbot that answers customer questions automatically.” |
| **Main Focus**     | Analytics + modeling                                           | Engineering + deployment                                          |
| **Tools**          | Python, Jupyter, Pandas, Statistics, ML                        | Python, FastAPI, Docker, Cloud (AWS/GCP/Azure), MLflow            |
| **End Goal**       | Insights and ML models                                         | Production-ready AI systems                                       |

## Simple Analogy

* A **Data Scientist** is like a **scientist** who discovers how things work.
* An **AI Engineer** is like an **engineer** who builds real machines from those discoveries.
