🔹 From Large Language Models to Foundation Models

Foundation Models (FMs) go beyond text.  
They are trained on multiple types of data, such as:

- Text
- Images
- Audio
- Code
- Video
- Structured data

This makes them capable of:

- Multimodal reasoning
- Image generation
- Video analysis
- Speech-to-text
- Complex tool use
- Robotics and automation tasks

Foundation models are “general-purpose intelligent systems” that can be adapted to thousands of use cases.
