## 🔹 From Foundation Models to AI Engineering

AI Engineering is the discipline of turning foundation models into real products.  
This involves:

- Understanding model capabilities
- Designing the user experience
- Building APIs and backend services
- Prompt engineering
- Evaluating outputs and improving quality
- Deploying applications on cloud platforms
- Monitoring performance and safety
- Automating workflows around AI

AI Engineers = the people who ship real AI software.
