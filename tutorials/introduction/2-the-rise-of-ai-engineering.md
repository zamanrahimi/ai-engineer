## ⭐ The Rise of AI Engineering

AI engineering is becoming one of the most important technical roles today.
It involves building real products using AI models — not just training models, but integrating them into apps, APIs, workflows, and businesses.

The rise of AI engineering happened because models became so powerful that:

* You don’t need to train everything from scratch.

* You can build production AI apps quickly.

* Companies want applied AI more than theoretical ML.
