# Understanding Foundation Models

Foundation models are large AI models trained on massive datasets and designed to be adapted to many tasks—such as text, images, coding, or speech—without needing to be retrained from scratch.

## Example
GPT-4, Claude, and Gemini are foundation models.  
You can use them for writing, coding, chatbots, translation, summarization, and more, all without building a model from the ground up.
